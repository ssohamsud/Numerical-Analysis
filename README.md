My notes and work on ICL MATH50003 

How to use the Julia Dual Number Differentiator:

1. Run the script dual.jl in either the terminal or the Julia REPL
2. The differentiator will load and give you an example usage of the script.
3. Define your own function and the value you require to evaluate the derivative as a Float64 type
4. Enjoy Differentiating


How it works:

1. In lectures we were taught how to use 'dual numbers' and how we can use them to quickly calculate derivatives of functions at certain values.
2. In short - we use standard polynomial values and expansions to calculate the derivates at specific values and at other for more complex functions such as exp, sin, cos: we approximate the functions using the first few terms of their Taylor Expansion.
